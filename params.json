For a longer explanation please refer to this [link](http://www.tradingsetupsreview.com/three-bar-reversal-pattern-day-trading/).  \r\nThe underlying asset is the **SP&500 index**, starting from the turmoil of global financial markets during August 2015. My focus is to simulate an intraday trading with a 5 minutes time frame, LONG only, so the pattern is used to buy a position and sell it at a higher price (hopefully). All simulations are tested with my software libraries written in R.\r\n\r\n##### Bearish and sideways cycle\r\n1. Simulations assuming Slippage = 0\r\n  1.

[Three bars reversal with momentum](https://nalon99.github.io/publications/three_bars/setup_3bars_enhanced_no_slippage.html)\r\n2. Simulations assuming Slippage = 1 basis point\r\n  1.

[Three bars reversal with momentum](https://nalon99.github.io/publications/three_bars/setup_3bars_enhanced_slippage.html)\r\n\r\n##### Bearish end - Bullish cycle\r\n1. Simulations assuming Slippage = 0\r\n  1. [Three bars reversal](https://nalon99.github.io/publications/three_bars/setup_3bars_bullish_no_slippage.html)\r\n  2. [Three bars reversal with momentum](https://nalon99.github.io/publications/three_bars/setup_3bars_bullish_enhanced_no_slippage.html)\r\n2. Simulations assuming Slippage = 1 basis point\r\n  1. [Three bars reversal](https://nalon99.github.io/publications/three_bars/setup_3bars_bullish_slippage.html)\r\n  2. [Three bars reversal with momentum](https://nalon99.github.io/publications/three_bars/setup_3bars_bullish_enhanced_slippage.html)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second case (ii) uses the same pattern, and in addition adds a filter signal looking for an underlying \"momemtum\" of the trend, in order to avoid entering a long position when a downward price movement is occuring.\r\nAs many momentum indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.) this creates a lag of the responsiveness of the system, and during sideways period, may be uneffective.\r\n\r\n#### Conclusions\r\nMy view about this pattern is negative at least for the *bearish - sideways* scenario of the SP&500 index. Used for an intraday trading system, in particular with a short period (5 minutes) implies negative returns on the long run. Using a momentum indicator to filter out bad downward movements can help the overall result, but in a real trading environment with a slippage and commissions it's not enough.\r\nWhere this pattern really shines is with an upward movement of the underlying trend, and in such a case it works. In particular adding a filter based on the momentum makes the difference. In addition, a trailing stop placed to the previous lows seems to be the best way to manage each trade.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
