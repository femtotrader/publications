A repository for my ongoing research...

This repository hosts some results of my research about trading strategies and patterns in general.
With GitHub Pages I will add more content to the repository for different backtests and parameters used. Each html page with its results, will contain the parameters and in general all the conditions set to run the entire simulation.
